davetunes-0.1
=================

davetunes is a simple script for organizing mp3 files into directories by artist and album.

it is aimed at users who prefer lightweight music players that don't have library management built in, or for users who have a messy soulseek downloads folder and don't want to launch a bloated music player to organize it for them, or anyone else who just feels like using this.

this script depends on mutagen to read metadata (http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/) - you must have this installed to run davetunes.

THIS IS VERY MUCH IN ALPHA DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE MAKE BACKUPS OF ANY FILES YOU DECIDE TO TEST THIS CODE ON, PLEASE!!!

to use:

$ python davetunes-0.1.py [source path] [destination path]
